The escalating cost of living crisis and the ever-present energy dilemma has created a critical need for dedicating time towards electricity usage tracking and cost management. With the rising price of energy, individuals or households are experiencing significant financial strain, proving it necessary to find ways to reduce stress and expenses. Additionally, this calls for immediate action to promote scalable energy practices and minimise wasteful consumption. In developing a website that enables users to track their electricity usage and understand what causes high costs, I aim to help individuals to take substantial steps toward mitigating the energy crisis.
